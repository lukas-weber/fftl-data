# Monte Carlo data

The json files in this directory contain Monte Carlo expectation values and errorbars for different parameters. The meanings of the model specific parameters are:

* `T`: temperature
* `J1`/`J2`/`J3`: intratrimer couplings
* `Jn`/`Jnn`: intertrimer couplings (`Jn=Jnn` always)
* `Lx`/`Ly`: system size in unit cells

For the Ising simulations, `J` and `h` are the coupling and the magnetic field.

To see the correlation between data files, specific observables and figures, please refer to the script files.
